### About Bit Spittle

Welcome to my corner of the internet. Make yourself comfortable -- we don't take ourselves too seriously around here.

This place aims to be a collection of articles and tutorials that are fun to read, easy to understand, interactive
(when possible), concise, and useful.

### About Me

My name is [David Herman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hermandave/).

I'm a programmer with 20 years of experience, the first 10 in the game industry and the next 10 at Google.

In the game industry, I worked on the PC MMORPG [EverQuest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest) and later
[MLB: The Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB:_The_Show) on PlayStation consoles. In Google, I first worked at
YouTube, helping bring the YouTube player into the living room (via the Xbox 360 console). Later, I switched to work on
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), the official IDE for Android development.

Blah blah blah. Those interested in more detail can check out [my resume](/resume.pdf).

Over my career, I've done a bunch of tools and UI work, and I enjoy interacting with our users (even on bugs reports!).
Although I have plenty of experience with (non-web) frontend experience, I like to get my hands dirty across the full
stack when possible.

More recently, as a tech lead, I have a track record of delivering software features on time. Besides programming
itself, I enjoy navigating the dynamics of teams: enabling collaboration and autonomy in others, generating
psychological safety, and providing mentorship.
